		<h2 id="device">Devices</h2>

		<p>The first way we will get an extra account is on your mobile device. Unfortunately, I do not know how to do this on Android, if I find out a way, I'll update this post. On iOS (Apple devices), there is a quick and easy method of gaining 1 extra account. Follow the below steps to get 1 extra account.</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Sign out of Game Center. Game Center is going to stop us from creating a new account.</li>

			<li>Link your main account to Facebook so it can't be lost.</li>

			<li>Then, go into your settings in the game and sign out of Facebook. You will appear on a new account.</li>

			<li>Logging in/out of Facebook in game will swap between the two accounts.</li>
		</ol>

		<h2 id="emulator">Emulators</h2>

		<p>How we'll get most of the accounts is through emulators. For those who don't know what an emulator is, it is hardware or software or both that duplicates (or emulates) the functions of one computer system (the guest) in another computer system (the host), different from the first one, so that the emulated behavior closely resembles the behavior of the real system (the guest).</p>

		<p>These emulators that we will be using are Bluestacks, Andy, and GenyMotion. They are all software for your computer and can be installed and ran instantly (except GenyMotion). Each emulator is supported on Windows, Mac, and Linux.</p>

		<h2 id="how">How They Work</h2>

		<p>The emulators duplicate Android's operating system. In doing this, you have access to the Play Store to download all the apps you would normally be able to get on your device.</p>

		<p>Since your accounts are linked by your GMail address on Android, you will need to create a new one for each account. You won't need to remember the details for each email unless you plan on logging in elsewhere.</p>

		<h2 id="ba">Bluestacks &amp; Andy</h2>

		<p>Bluestacks and Andy are your plug and play emulators, meaning that once you install them, you can download apps instantly. Bluestacks however isn't a full emulator, it is just an app player though that isn't a problem.</p>

		<h3 id="blue">Bluestacks</h3>

		<p>Bluestacks can be downloaded from <a href="http://bluestacks.com">here</a>. Since this is an App Player and not an emulator, installing apps is a little different. Once you have installed the player and opened it, click the search button at the top left and type in <q>Empire Z</q> (or another game) into the search. Then click the <q>Search Play for Empire Z</q> button. After clicking this, you will be guided through an account creation so you can download Empire Z.</p>

		<h3 id="andy">Andy</h3>

		<p>Andy is a lot more simple and straightforward. Once installed, you treat it like your mobile device. It also runs faster than Bluestacks which is a definite plus! You can download Andy from <a href="http://andyroid.net">here</a>.</p>

		<h2 id="geny">GenyMotion</h2>

		<p>Now GenyMotion is a different one. Requires a little bit of set up but you can create as many accounts as you want. It is also the fastest emulator I've ever seen!</p>

		<h3>Steps to Set up</h3>

		<ol>
			<li>Create an account on the <a href="http://genymotion.com">GenyMotion website</a>.
			</li>

			<li>Download and install GenyMotion.</li>

			<li>Download and extract this <a href="http://adf.ly/ujeIX">ZIP archive</a>. (<a href="http://bit.ly/1yl0Dof">Mirror</a>)
			</li>

			<li>Sign into your account in the program.</li>

			<li>Click the "Add" button and choose your device (I highly recommend <q>Google Nexus 10 - 4.3</q>)</li>

			<li>Name the device whatever you want and click next. You cannot rename the device after it's created.</li>

			<li>Once the device has finished creating, click Finish.</li>

			<li>Now select that device and click <q>Start</q>.</li>

			<li>Once you get to the main screen of the device, drag and drop the <span id="bold">GenyMotion-ARM-Translation_v1.1.zip</span> archive into the device window.</li>

			<li>If done correctly, it should say <q>File transfer in progress</q>. Once it asks you to flash it, click <q>Ok</q></li>

			<li>Once it's finished, close the window and re-open the device.</li>

			<li>This time, you want to open the version folder from the ZIP archive in step 3 that corresponds to the device version, for example, if you made a Google Nexus 10 - 4.3, you will use the 4.3 oone. Drag that ZIP file into the window like you did in step 9.</li>

			<li>Once it finishes, close and re-open the device again.</li>

			<li>Open your apps and Play Store should be available, if not, start again from step 5.</li>

			<li>Opening Play Store will guide you through an account creation.</li>

			<li>You can now download Empire Z.</li>

			<li>Repeat steps 5-16 for each account.</li>
